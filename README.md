## Problem Statement
Passwords and PINs, once considered secure, are now vulnerable to hacking and phishing attacks, which can result in financial losses and identity theft. The task is to develop a comprehensive and robust system that ensures the security of transactions using facial recognition, providing a cross-platform, more secure, user-friendly, and convenient authentication method while ensuring the protection of personal information against fraud and spoofing. 
The facial recognition system should be able to recognize faces in different lighting conditions, angles, and orientations such as using photographs or masks while protecting user privacy. 

## Our solution
- Incorporation of ***facial recognition technology*** to enhance reliability, safety and make the application user-friendly. 
- Inclusion of an ***extra layer of authentication*** by utilizing ***Aadhar API*** to verify the user’s credentials and cross-check the Aadhar photograph with live-image. 
- Integration of an ***expense tracking feature*** to easily monitor the user’s spending habits. So users can view their transaction history, and manage their finances.
